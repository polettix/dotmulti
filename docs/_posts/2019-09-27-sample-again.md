**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!

## A long story short...

This is \(x = 100 \Rightarrow x > 99\) some maths:

$$ \alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac1i $$

This is all folks!

## Some code...

Here is some Perl code:

{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.024;
use warnings;

say 'Hello, World!';
{% endhighlight %}
